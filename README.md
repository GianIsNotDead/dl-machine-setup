Total Cost: Too Much!
I accidentally picked the most expensive motherboard on display, becuase the Best Buy employee didn't put it on the right shelf. I assume any motherboard with PCIe interface would work.
I also use my machine for data storage, so I chose SSD with with a bit more disk space.
As far as I know, RTX 2080 is the cheapest GPU from Nvidia that's compatible with Cuda, and has decent performance.

## Operating System:
I use Ubuntu 18.04.1 with x86_64 architecture.

## GPU Setup:
1. Install driver like [this one][https://www.nvidia.com/download/driverResults.aspx/150803/en-us] or newer version. 
2. Install Cuda based on machine's operating system and architecture.

In terminal type:
`nvidia-smi`
It should display driver and cuda version.
