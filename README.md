Total Cost: Too Much!  
I accidentally picked the most expensive motherboard on display, becuase it was put on the wrong shelf with wrong price tag. I assume any motherboard with PCIe interface would work.  
I also use my machine for data storage, so I chose SSD with with a bit more disk space.  
As far as I know, RTX 2080 is the cheapest GPU from Nvidia that's compatible with Cuda, and has decent performance.  

## Operating System:
I use Ubuntu 18.04.1 with x86_64 architecture.  

## GPU Setup:
1. Install driver like [this one][https://www.nvidia.com/download/driverResults.aspx/150803/en-us] or newer version. 
2. Install Cuda based on machine's operating system and architecture.

In terminal type:  
```nvidia-smi```  
It should display driver and cuda version.

## Configure for Remote Operation:
Install Open SSH Server:  
```sudo apt install openssh-server```  
Once installed, a daemon is created to listen to connection requests.  
To make it's running, type:  
```sudo systemctl status ssh```  

## Firewall Setup:
We have to allow network traffic on port 22.
Depending on the operating system. Ubuntu has a user friendly interface called UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) to configure network setting.  
It's disabled by default, but if it isn't, type:  
```sudo ufw allow ssh```  
To check the status of the firework:  
```sudo ufw status verbose```  

NOTE: This allows access to all the machines connected via the same network. 
If accessing from a different network, the router which the ssh sever connected to might need to be configured to forward the packet.

## Connecting to the Server:
Depending on the client machine, a ssh client might be necessary.
Get the ip address of ssh server machine:  
```ip a | grep inet```  
Pick the one that's on the wireless network. It has something like ```wlo1``` in the network description.  
The command to connect on the client machine looks something like:  
```ssh name_of_my_machine@10.0.189.229```
